## Declaration of AI Usage


### 1. AI Systems Used

The following AI systems were used during the development of this assignment:

- GitHub Copilot (VS Code extension)
    
- Google Translate
    
- Microsoft Copilot / ChatGPT‑style assistant (for documentation support)
    

No other AI tools were used.

### 2. How and Where AI Was Used

AI tools were used as supportive assistants. They did not replace human understanding, design decisions, or implementation work.

#### a) Coding Assistance (GitHub Copilot)

GitHub Copilot was used inside VS Code to assist with:

- Generating boilerplate code
    
- Suggesting refactoring options
    
- Helping with TypeScript typings
    
- Providing examples of React, Express, and MUI usage
    
- Reducing repetitive coding tasks
    

All generated code was manually reviewed, tested, and modified. No code was accepted without understanding how it works.

#### b) UI Development

UI work is typically time‑consuming. Copilot helped by:

- Suggesting Material UI component structures
    
- Speeding up layout and styling
    
- Helping resolve common UI errors
    

This saved significant time and allowed more focus on application logic.

#### c) Documentation and English Language Support

Google Translate and Microsoft Copilot were used to:

- Improve English grammar and clarity
    
- Translate Finnish → English
    
- Structure documentation more professionally
    
- Help express technical ideas in clearer English
    

The author is not a native English speaker, and AI tools supported language quality.

#### d) Learning and Problem‑Solving

AI assistance helped with:

- Refreshing MERN‑stack knowledge
    
- Understanding TypeScript issues
    
- Interpreting error messages
    
- Exploring alternative implementation approaches
     

AI acted as a learning aid, not as an autonomous developer.

### 3. Critical Reflection on AI Usage

AI assistance was helpful for:

- Speeding up UI implementation
    
- Reducing repetitive coding work
    
- Improving documentation quality
    
- Supporting TypeScript problem‑solving
    

However, AI suggestions required:

- Careful review
    
- Technical understanding
    
- Manual correction
    
- Awareness of limitations
    

Using AI effectively required experience and critical evaluation.

### 4. Statement of Responsibility

All final decisions, architecture choices, and code integrations were made by the author. All features were manually implemented, tested, and verified. AI suggestions were used only when fully understood and validated. The author takes full responsibility for the correctness and quality of the work.
